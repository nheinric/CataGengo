# Description

This document describes initial setup and installation procedure for the
CataGengo demonstration suite.

It is built on the [Catalyst](http://www.catalystframework.org/) web framework for perl.

# Installation

## Assumptions
 1. You have access to a browser supported by [jQuery](http://docs.jquery.com/Browser_Compatibility)
 1. You are installing on a UNIX-like environment
 1. You have perl 5.10.1+ installed
 1. You are using [local::lib](http://search.cpan.org/~apeiron/local-lib-1.008004/lib/local/lib.pm), or you don't mind if Catalyst installs a bunch of perl modules on your system.
 * If you have questions about any of the above, drop me a line!

## Steps
In all steps below, if you are asked whether to install a dependency, always answer _yes_

 1. Install cpanminus
   * This is a great package installer that should make the rest of the installation much smoother
   * `cpan -i App::cpanminus`
 1. Download and install [WebService::MyGengo](https://github.com/downloads/nheinric/WebService--MyGengo/WebService-MyGengo-0.010.tar.gz)
   * At the time of this writing, the module is not yet on the CPAN, so you must install it by hand
   * `cd <the module directory> && cpanm --installdeps .`
   * `perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && sudo make install`
 1. Download and install [Catalyst::Model::WebService::MyGengo](https://github.com/downloads/nheinric/Catalyst--Model--WebService--MyGengo/Catalyst-Model-WebService-MyGengo-0.001.tar.gz)
   * At the time of this writing, the module is not yet on the CPAN, so you must install it by hand
   * `cd <the module directory> && cpanm --installdeps .`
   * `perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && sudo make install`
 1. Download and install CataGengo
   * **NOTE: `make install` is not necessary!**
   * `cd CataGengo && cpanm --installdeps .`
   * `perl Makefile.PL && make && make test`
 1. Done!

# Running the App

## Mock Mode
In mock mode, all requests will be handled by a local object that mimics the action of the sandbox.

No requests to the real sandbox will be made, so you can test to your heart's content without worrying about throttling.

However, if you stop/start the server, **all of your test Jobs will vanish**.

 1. Run the local server:
   * `CATAGENGO_HOME=. ./script/catagengo_server.pl -d`
 1. Open [http://127.0.0.1:3000/mygengo](http://127.0.0.1:3000/mygengo) in your browser of choice
 1. Click the 'Create a New Job' tab to make a Job
 1. Test to your heart's content!
   * Note: your credits in the 'Account' tab will not decrease. This is considered a feature, as you can test forever!

## Sandbox Mode
If you make a lot of requests the sandbox may begin to throttle you (which manifests as all requests resulting in an "authentication didn't pass" error.)

If this happens you'll need to wait awhile (not sure how long...) until you can test again.

 1. Open catagengo.conf. It will look like the following:

        <Model::MyGengo>
        #    class           WebService::MyGengo::Client
            class           CataGengo::Test::Util::Client
            public_key      pubkey
            private_key     privkey
            use_sandbox     1
        </Model::MyGengo>
 1. Swap the commented `class` lines so they look like this:

        <Model::MyGengo>
            class           WebService::MyGengo::Client
        #    class           CataGengo::Test::Util::Client
            public_key      pubkey
            private_key     privkey
            use_sandbox     1
        </Model::MyGengo>
 1. Replace 'pubkey' and 'privkey' with your sandbox API public and private keys
   * If you have any "#" characters in your keys, you must escape them with a backslash: \\#
 1. Save the file and run the local server:
   * `CATAGENGO_HOME=. ./script/catagengo_server.pl -d`
 1. Open [http://127.0.0.1:3000/mygengo](http://127.0.0.1:3000/mygengo) in your browser of choice
 1. Click the 'Jobs' tab to view your Jobs in the sandbox
   * If you have a lot of Jobs, the page will take awhile to load the first time
   * Subsequent loads will be quicker because the Job list is cached internally
   * If you update a Job in the sandbox, open the Job list or Job details click the 'Refresh Data' button to refresh data from the API

## Live Mode
Live mode works exactly like Sandbox mode, only you'll be interacting with the production myGengo server.

**YOU WILL BE CHARGED FOR NEW JOBS CREATED IN THIS MODE!**

 1. Open catagengo.conf again and:
   1. Change your public/private keys to your production API keys
   1. Change `use_sandbox` to 0
 1. Save the file and run the local server:
   * `CATAGENGO_HOME=. ./script/catagengo_server.pl -d`
