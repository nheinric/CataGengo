This is a demo app built on the perl web framework: Catalyst.

It flexes many aspects of the myGengo API and can be used for local (mock) testing as well as sandbox access.

The app is based on the WebService::MyGengo API library and the Catalyst::Model::WebService::MyGengo module.

See INSTALL.html to get started!
